# BoomPS

**Author:** Angela Zhang

**Design:** Deliver bombs to our clients across the city as quickly as you can - and we *do* mean as quickly as possible. Try not to explode under the pressure!

**How To Play:**

WASD to move, click to use camera. When you're in range of a building, you can press E to interact & deliver the bomb.

Red floating markers indicate which building you should be delivering to.

The game portion ended up being greatly simplified from the original plan due to time constraints and WalkMesh debugging taking longer than expected; with more time, I would have liked to create a more elaborate city and add BGM & SFX to make it more exciting :)
